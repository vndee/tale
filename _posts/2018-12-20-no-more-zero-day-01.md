Because my writting skill is very bad, I decided to read something and write down word-by-word in this NMZD series. I hope it will help me to improve my writting skill.

From quora: [Why do people always expect more from me?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-always-expect-more-from-me)

People expect from other people who are capable of achieving. A simple example would be "Nobody asks a beggar for money, they always ask a rich person because they know that probability of getting money is more in case of rich people".

If somebody expects something of you, it is a good thing. You should feel proud of that. And if they push you harder for more, certainly they are well wisher who literally knows what you are capable of which you might not be aware of.

It is the worst feeling when nobody expects anything from you and considers you as trash of just waste. It brings negativity in life.
