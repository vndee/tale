I am a computer science enthusiast. In my major English is extremely important, so I decide to improve my English. At first, I built this blog to write and improve my writting skill. I tried to run some plan, but it seem unnecessary. To day, I have started No More Zero Day (NMZD). NMZD was inspired from an amazing blog of my friend (https://coderboy23.herokuapp.com/home). I hope this plan will bring me to the world.

I am going to do final test in database system course tomorrow.
