I am a computer science enthusiast. In my major English is extremely important, so I decide to improve my English. At first, I built this blog to write and improve my writting skill. I tried to run some plan, but it seem unnecessary. To day, I have started No More Zero Day (NMZD). NMZD was inspired from an amazing blog of my friend (https://coderboy23.herokuapp.com/home). I hope this plan will bring me to the world.

I am going to do final test in database system course tomorrow. In this semester, I had many lessons at 6:50 am. This lesson time made me tired. I have actually gone to school at the early morning for some lessons and until 12:00 am and work as an internship research at AI Lab til 18:00. I think I did hardwork this semester, so I don't want to fail in the final test.
